These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic flaws, including:\n\n  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.\n\n  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.\n\nAn attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and clients.\n\nAlthough SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that these protocols be disabled entirely.\n\nNIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1, any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong cryptography'.",
